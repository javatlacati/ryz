Ryz is a statically typed object oriented programming language for the JVM with ( almost ) no keywords nor control structures. It is **similar** to Smalltalk in the sense it uses code blocks for control, but with the Java/Javascript/Scala "look and feel":

```
demo.HelloWorld {
  main() {
     "Hello, world!".println()
   }
}
```


Status: currently under construction.
