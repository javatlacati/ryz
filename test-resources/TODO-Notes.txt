DONE - To remove exception in the byte code use something like javassist see: so/4337281
- Support multiple public class in the same source
- Create attribute and don't duplicate it when defined in method :-S
STARTED - Create Bool class and simple blocks of code.
DONE - Args, varargs
 named args with default values
- get/set properties like generation

DONE needs more work - Indicate what lines haven't been processed
DONE needs more work - Compile using a classpath  ( to load existing classes )
STARTED - Work on blocks.
    - Block literal
    - Block invocation
    - Block identification
    - Multiparam blocks
STARTED - Extension methods
    - For core libraries ( if, for, while etc )
- Infer type from expresion ie:
   result = some.method() // method type = int "result" should be declared as "int"
- Casts // java int i = ( int ) 0L -> i : Int = Int( 0L )
- Expression type identification: a.b(c).d(e.f(g)) is of type returned by "d"
